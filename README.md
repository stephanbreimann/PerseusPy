# PerseusPy - Proteomics Analysis in Python 
PerseusPy is a toolkit to analyze proteomics data as performed in the Perseus software. After initial definition of the target groups, 
the whole Perseus pipeline can be run and the results can be visualized by a Volcano plot. Novel imputation methods will be included in future.
